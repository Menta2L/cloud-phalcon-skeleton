Cloud 9 Living Phalcon PHP Skeleton

Version 3.0.1 out now! This is a very robust update to Phalcon's MVC setup. It provides support for the following:

* Better module loading system (through etc/modules/Module_Name.xml) 
* Multiple websites linked to the database
* Separate design directories for each website. The directories can also be setup to "fall back" from an override package to the default package (great for things like holiday skins, etc)
* Cloud-dev-tools for quickly creating models in the appropriate module
* Overriden front controller and init process (gutted Phalcon defaults)
* Redis support for cache/session
* Redis admin
* The ability to register event observers and module front names in the module configuration files. 
* Built in support for a url rewriter / redirect


More to come when I have time to comment!
